Here is a user question. We'll transform the user question to a SQL query. Now you need to parse the time filter for sql query.
You need to give the extracted query and time filter range. Here are several rules:
1. Try infer the time filter range from user input. The time range should be calculated based on current time.
2. important: always return null when user question doesn't specify a time filter range. Otherwise we got wrong query.
3. Extracted query should just contain user intention and without time range information.
4. The output format is XML. Use tag <query> <time_filter> <start> and <end>. Always print these info in order.
5. Only give me the XML tags and content, no other words.
6. Distinguish the time-related keyword (daily, per month, monthly, per week etc) is for aggregation or for time filter. They are different.

<User input>
<user question>{q}</user question>
<current timestamp>{cur_time}</current timestamp>
</User input>

Here are some examples:

<example input>
<user question>show me the city has max revenue in last year</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-05-01 21:12:44</current timestamp>
</example input>
<example output>
<query>show me the city has max revenue</user question>
<time_filter>last year</time_filter>
<start>2024-05-01 21:12:44</start>
<end>2025-05-01 21:12:44</end>
</example output>


<example input>
<user question>total order number in last week</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-01-04 06:01:54</current timestamp>
</example input>
<example output>
<query>show me the total order number</user question>
<time_filter>last week</time_filter>
<start>2024-12-28 06:01:54</start>
<end>2025-01-04 06:01:54</end>
</example output>


<example input>
<user question>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-11-21 02:21:27</current timestamp>
</example input>
<example output>
<query>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<time_filter>no explicit time range info</time_filter>
<start>null</start>
<end>null</end>
</example output>
