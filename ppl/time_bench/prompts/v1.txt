The input is a question. You need to parse the time scope for the question. Here are several rules:

1. Distinguish the time related keyword is used for question scope, or aggregation(daily, per month, monthly, per week etc). We only need to parse question time scope.
2. Important: give null when question doesn't specify a time scope.
3. When we have time scope, infer the scope range from user input and current time.
4. When we have time scope, give the normalized question without the time-scope related expression.
4. The output format is XML. Use tag <query> <time_filter> <start> and <end>. Always print these info in order.
5. Only give me the XML tags and content, no other words.

<User input>
<user question>{q}</user question>
<current timestamp>{cur_time}</current timestamp>
</User input>

Here are some examples:

<example input>
<user question>show me the city has max revenue in last year</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-05-01 21:12:44</current timestamp>
</example input>
<example output>
<query>show me the city has max revenue</user question>
<time_filter>last year</time_filter>
<start>2024-05-01 21:12:44</start>
<end>2025-05-01 21:12:44</end>
</example output>


<example input>
<user question>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-11-21 02:21:27</current timestamp>
</example input>
<example output>
<query>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<time_filter>no explicit time range info</time_filter>
<start>null</start>
<end>null</end>
</example output>
