The input is a question. You need to parse the [ time scope ] and [ aggregation time unit ] for the question. Here are several rules:

1. Distinguish the time related keyword is used for question scope(last week, Febrary etc), or aggregation(daily, monthly, per week, every week etc).
2. Important: give null when not enough information or not confident to parse.
3. When we have time scope, infer the scope range from user input and current time.
4. When we have time scope, give the normalized question without the time-scope related expression.
4. The output format is XML. Use tag <agg> <scope> <query> <start> and <end>. Always print these info in order.
5. For <agg> <scope> , copy and paste the text from user question.
6. Only give me the XML tags and content, no other words.

<User input>
<user question>{q}</user question>
<current timestamp>{cur_time}</current timestamp>
</User input>

Here are some examples:

<example input>
<user question>show me the city has max revenue in last year</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-05-01 21:12:44</current timestamp>
</example input>

<example output>
<agg>null</agg>
<scope>last year</scope>
<query>show me the city has max revenue</user question>
<start>2024-05-01 21:12:44</start>
<end>2025-05-01 21:12:44</end>
</example output>


<example input>
<user question>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<current timestamp>2025-11-21 02:21:27</current timestamp>
</example input>

<example output>
<agg>monthly</agg>
<scope>null</scope>
<query>show me the monthly total revenue</user question>
<start>null</start>
<end>null</end>
</example output>
